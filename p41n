how am i supposed to trust people who say exercise is good, when i get up to get a drink and some snacks, and then have to sit back down because my chest is hurting…?
clearly it’s not good for me or doing me good?! unless chest pain is just normal and people have come to accept that, but, for me, chest pain isn’t a thing i want to encourage??
