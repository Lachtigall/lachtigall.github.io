I won't be around for the couple/few days, in any notable capacity.

One of the front USB ports on my computer has died, while doing nothing in particular. My mouse stopped working, and I looked underneath it to see if it was still turned on, it was powered off. I tried a different mouse, and still nothing. Trying the mice in a different machine shows they do work. This was the only free USB port I had on my computer that was close enough to have the mouse actually reach my desk, because of its cable length. So, I can't use my mouse now, which reasonably means I can't use my computer. To fix it, I need to save for and purchase a USB hub, and possibly a USB cable extension, to be able to get USB ports close enough to my desk to be able to use a mouse from.

It's not a good time at all for this to happen, not doing great with money right now by any length.

I was lost for words when this happened, and while my PC case is a very cheap one, I didn't expect it to be this low quality to have a USB port just die.

So, basically, I won't be using my computer until I can get those and do that.

[and no, there's no reasonable workaround for this that I can think of, I can't physically move the computer, that would cause more issues, there's no ports I can reasonably free up (my PC has very few to begin with), and I don't have any kind of USB-free wireless mouse to use, even temporarily.]

be back when this is all sorted i guess.
